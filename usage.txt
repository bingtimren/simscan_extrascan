Usage:
======================================================
If environment variable SIMSCAN_EXTRASCAN is present, this patch makes simscan to execute the content of the variable 
with a popen call, i.e. by a shell. The user executing the command will be 'vpopmail' and the current dir is a working
dir, into which simscan has put the message as well as attachments extracted by ripmime. The command can simply inspect
the message or attachment and return 0 if inspection is OK or other code if intend to block the message.

Note: 'vpopmail' will run the command but attachment is owned and only readable by simscan, therefore the command will
not be able to inspect attachment. My solution is to allow vpopmail sudo as simscan to inspect the attachment. To do
this, administrator needs to edit the sudo configuration (use /usr/sbin/visudo) and make the following two changes:

Change 1: comment out "requiretty" since no tty is available

# Defaults    requiretty

Change 2: allow vpopmail run as simscan in executing necessary commands (for example, zipinfo)

# vpopmail will be able to call zipinfo anywhere (EXAMPLE)
vpopmail        ALL=(simscan) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/zipinfo

Below are samples of extra-scanner commands
======================================================
1.block 'exe in zip' with logging. you may want to adjust max zip-file size, 800000 in this case. oversized zip will be passed through

SIMSCAN_EXTRASCAN='logger "simscan-extrascan: working on dir `pwd`";for i in *.zip;do logger "simscan-extrascan: checking $i";if [ $(stat -c%s "$i") -lt 800000 ];then if sudo -u simscan /usr/bin/zipinfo -1 "$i" 2>&1|/bin/grep -i exe$ >/dev/null;then logger "simscan-extrascan: exe found in $i, exiting 1";exit 1;else logger "simscan-extrascan: $i clean";fi;else logger "simscan-extrascan: $i too large (size=`stat -c%s "$i"`), ignore";fi;done;logger "simscan-extrascan: all clean, exiting 0";exit 0'

(requires configuration of sudo, see above)

2. block 'exe in zip' without logging (adjust max zip-file size before applying)

SIMSCAN_EXTRASCAN='for i in *.zip;do if [ $(stat -c%s "$i") -lt 7200000 ];then if sudo -u simscan /usr/bin/zipinfo -1 "$i" 2>&1|/bin/grep -i \\.exe$ >/dev/null;then exit 1;fi;fi;done;exit 0'

(requires configuration of sudo, see above)
